# prideflags
A little TKinter program to draw pride flags.

To run: simply download and extract the file and run "python prideflags.py" from the command line. 

Currently available flags:
gay
bi
trans
lesbian
enby
pan
ace

I have plans to add demisexual and intersex flags, but I'll have to learn a bit more Turtle Graphics to learn how to draw circles and angles.
